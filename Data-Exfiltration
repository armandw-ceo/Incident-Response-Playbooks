# üõ°Ô∏è Data Exfiltration Incident Response Playbook

## üîç 1. Detection

### ‚úÖ Detection Checklist
- [ ] SIEM alerts for large data transfers or abnormal file access
- [ ] DLP (Data Loss Prevention) tool triggers on sensitive file movement
- [ ] Unusual outbound network traffic (e.g., cloud uploads, FTP/SFTP, Tor)
- [ ] Access of sensitive files outside normal working hours
- [ ] Detection of known exfiltration tools or malware (e.g., C2 communication)
- [ ] Alerts from cloud service logs (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, Box)

### Logs/Tools to Use:
- SIEM (Splunk, QRadar, ELK)
- DLP systems (Symantec, Microsoft Purview, Forcepoint)
- EDR/AV logs
- Firewall and proxy logs
- Cloud audit logs (e.g., Google Workspace, M365, AWS)

---

## üß™ 2. Investigation

### Key Actions:
- Identify systems or users involved in data access or movement
- Determine what data was accessed or copied
- Analyze outbound traffic destinations, volume, and protocols
- Match access times with user working hours or behavioral baselines
- Review file-level access logs (file shares, SharePoint, OneDrive, etc.)
- Search for tools used to compress, encrypt, or stage data for exfil

### Tools:
- DLP console for alerts and file tracking
- Cloud service logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, GDrive audit)
- Firewall/NetFlow data
- EDR agent history
- Threat intel feeds to check IPs or destinations

---

## üö® 3. Containment

### Immediate Steps:
- Block ongoing data transfers or exfiltration channels (e.g., FTP, cloud app access)
- Disable compromised user accounts or isolate affected systems
- Revoke API tokens or third-party app integrations
- Quarantine any malware or staging scripts
- Restrict egress traffic or apply temporary firewall rules

---

## üîß 4. Eradication

### Removal Tasks:
- Remove exfiltration tools or malware from endpoints
- Disable or uninstall malicious applications or browser extensions
- Reset credentials and tokens used in unauthorized transfers
- Patch vulnerabilities (if exploited to gain access)
- Remove or archive logs from unauthorized applications/scripts

---

## üîÅ 5. Recovery

### Restore Normal Operations:
- Re-enable accounts or access only after validating integrity
- Reconfigure cloud or on-prem access control policies
- Resume business operations with additional monitoring
- Restore user trust (if impacted)
- Ensure logging and DLP protections are active and effective

---

## üìù 6. Lessons Learned

### Post-Incident Activities:
- Determine root cause and impact (What data? Who? How?)
- Update DLP policies or SIEM detection rules
- Conduct user awareness training (especially around file sharing)
- Improve visibility into sensitive file access and movement
- Update playbooks and conduct internal briefing
