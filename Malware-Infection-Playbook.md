# Malware Infection Incident Response Playbook

## Detection

- User reported downloading malicious file or clicking malicious link
- Antivirus/EDR alert triggered 
- SIEM alert from log correlation
- IDS/IPS alert detected 
- Suspicious process execution
- Abnormal behavior on an endpoint

### Logs/Tools to Use:
- EDR console (file behaviors, processes, network calls)
- Windows Event Logs (4688, 4624, 7045, 1102)
- Sysmon (process trees, hash detection)
- DNS and firewall logs (malicious domains, C2 traffic)

---

## Investigation

- Identify affected systems and users
- Analyze file hashes and compare with threat intelligence feeds
- Review endpoint process trees and scheduled tasks
- Examine:
  - Recent downloads or suspicious binaries
  - Registry run keys or autoruns
  - Outbound traffic to suspicious IPs/domains

---

## Containment

- Isolate infected hosts from the network 
- Block known malicious IPs/domains at firewall or DNS level
- Quarantine detected malware via AV/EDR
- Disable compromised user accounts temporarily (if applicable)
- Stop suspicious processes or services

---

## Eradication

- Use EDR/AV to remove malware from infected hosts
- Remove persistence mechanisms:
  - Scheduled tasks
  - Run keys
  - Malicious services
- Clean temp directories and user profiles
- Reimage if infection is deep or cleanup is unreliable

---

## Recovery

- Patch exploited vulnerabilities (if any)
- Restore affected files/systems from backups (after validation)
- Reconnect isolated systems only after clearing infection
- Re-enable disabled accounts with updated credentials (if needed)
- Monitor previously affected systems closely for signs of reinfection

## üìù 6. Lessons Learned

- Perform a root cause analysis: How did the malware enter?
- Document all actions taken and incident timeline
- Update SIEM rules or EDR policies to improve detection
- Conduct a tabletop exercise or simulation based on the incident
- Reinforce user awareness and phishing training
